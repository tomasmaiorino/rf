It's a test application which perform a simple CRUD in to different resources and also provide a way to filter the values returned.

This application is running under Spring Boot and it uses a embedded


## Used Technologies

**1. Java version 8.**

**2. JPA:** Mapping persistent entities in domains objects.

**3. Spring Data JPA:** It's used to generate part of the code of the persistence layer.

## Additional Technologies

**Tests:** The tests are defined as use case of the Junit. The tests have been made available in the structure: src/test/java.

**Spring Boot:** It is important to check the application's profiles once that its use more than one. 

**Maven:** Life cycle management and project build.

## Considerations
 As I choose do not to return the model direct to the view, but to use a resource class for any model instead. I couldn't to use the spring's Projection to apply that return filter required on the test and didn't have enough time to found a more elegant solution.

 
## Business Rules
**1. The product's name and description are required.
**2. The image's type is required.
**3. If an image has been useb by a product, the image can not be deleted.
**4. If a product has a sub product it can be deleted.
**5. A product can only be associated to an image that has not been used by any other product.

## Final Considerations
In order to facilitate some tests, I created simple swagger doc through the spring-fox api.
The majority of tests can be made but the parameter's values need to be changed.
